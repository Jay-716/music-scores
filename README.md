# Music Scores Repo

Here are some scores for some of my favorite songs.

# Requirements

 - lilypond
 - timidity++ (Optional. For playing midi.)
 - Frescobaldi (Optional. A lilypond frontend.)

# Usage

`lilypond </path/to/score.ly>`

Then a pdf and a midi file will appear in the same directory.

# Notes

These scores are badly written since I lack enough music knowledge.
The rythm or even the pitches may be incorrect.
